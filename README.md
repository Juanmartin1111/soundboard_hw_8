# Welcome to the weapons gunshop. This game focuses on showing you nine different type of weapons and its unique sound.

Each weapon its represented by a picture as well as its name and unique sound.
You will be able to click on the picture and get the sound as well as press the key of the first initial letter of the weapon to play the corresponded sound. 
There is a little hand that will guide you through the room each time you select a picture. (This feature is a little off since the hand looks like is not corresponding well with the clicks).

There are two modes in which this game can be played:

1: If you LEFT click on the picture, the corresponded sound of the weapon will be played as well as a little zoom in will be generated. If you RIGHT click, the sound will also be played but this time it will zoom out. 
The purpose of the mode is to experience the corresponded sounds as well as trying to keep all the weapons aligned with the screen.
